# CardDrawProbabilities
Examples of algorithms that can be used to calculate the odds of getting particular combinations of cards by given turn. The algorithms support multiple card combinations at once, where each one has an individual turn restriction. The Unity project contains multiple tests to test out the algorithm's speed and compare results with other versions.
